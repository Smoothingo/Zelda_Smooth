# Things i have learned while coding this Project

I've learned that coding can be really fun even tough its sometimes stressfull and really frustrating.

Despite that i loved it and want to keep coding. My Goal is to learn C# or C++ and code a real Game with some Friends from my School and make it available on Steam. So this Project gave me the Starting Point in my Coding Career and teached me some valuable lessons.
