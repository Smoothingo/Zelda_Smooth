# Zelda_Smooth

## *Simple Text Adventure for a school Project*

I hope you enjoy it. This code is still in development and i will try to finish it in my Holidays because the School Project is already over.

I will maybe add features every now and then and will try to make a nice fighting system for the Titans and Ganon.

# Credits

To my Teacher who knows his Stuff and helped me learning the basics of python.

To the Great sources of the Internet and ChatGPT wich helped me a lot with inspiration and understanding some things i didnt learn in school

To my fellow student Paul because he played a big Role in helping me getting distracted from coding and so not finishing the Project till 13.04.2022 and as a consequence not having a nice Game to show to my Class ( Note: Im still 2nd best and my Game is THE BEST. PAUL FUCK YOU IN EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE.)

# Things i have learned while coding this Project

I've learned that coding is really fun even tough its sometimes stressfull and really annoying.

Despite that i loved it and want to keep coding. My Goal is to learn C# or C++ and code a real Game with some Friends from my School and make it available on Steam. So this Project gave me the Starting Point in my Coding Career i think and teached me some valuable lessons.
