Simple Text Adventure for a school Project
I hope you enjoy it. I will maybe add features every now and then. 
But as i said its for an School Project so i will probably onyl do it for learning purposes.
Still i love coding and want to improve as much as possible
Please leave Feedback and Tipps

To run the game just go in the main.py in the folder Zelda_Botw 
Youre open to use this code howeveryou want. (Note: I would love to see other Zelda_Botw Games)
